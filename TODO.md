* TODO

* Show snapshots of each input to assess quality of prediction
* Show letters in bias grid showing next bias, and which input it usually
* predicts.
* Should we try boosting distal synapses if active duty cycle low?

* We need to unlearn synapses that lead to bias noise.
* Bias should eventually be a subset of overlap

* Confirm in the bias condition, we are using current bias to predict
* next time step.


# EVENTUAL

* Render proximal connections (and re-initialize changes there too)
* Now it's time to build invariant SDRs at a higher region layer.
* These can predict all pattern members regardless of order.
